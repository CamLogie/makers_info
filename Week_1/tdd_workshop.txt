Test Driven Development:

What is it?
  - Creating tests to make sure something is functioning as you wish it would
  - Ensure your code is concise
  - Ensure your code does what it should
  - Behavior is the methods on the object at hand
  - Helps you think through the problem and test things you might not initially
    think about

How to write tests: RGR
  - R = Red, we want it to fail, tests should force you to make new behavior
  - G = Green, make it pass by writing the code
  - R = Refactor, improve the quality of the code w/o changing its behavior

What is RSPEC?
  - A gem that helps us check our code
  - Specifically tests Ruby code - almost like its own language
  - A bit like the mirrored version of Ruby
  - Has different conditionals and different rules
  - A DSL - specific to domain/environment of testing

Writing Tests Workshop:

  LO - Define unit testing as the process of testing the smallest possible
       'unit' of a program
     - Understand each of the 3 As of unit testing
     - Write some simple unit tests
