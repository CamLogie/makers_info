Object Oriented Programming Principles (5)

  1) Data Abstraction
    We want to model our data to look like a real life equivalent, ex: Ship
      - Ships are able to accelerate and move (methods) whilst they also have
        positional and speed constants at initialization
        class Ship
          ACCELERATION = 1
          def initialize
            @position = { x: 0, y: 0 }
            @speed = { x: 0, y: 0 }
          end
          def acceleration(direction)
            # ADDITIONAL CODE
          end
          def move
            # ADDITIONAL CODE
          end
        end
      - Good way to do this is in CLASSES, representing some structured data
  2) Encapsulation
    Principle of making sure that all the details of a particular object that
    need to be used outside the class are made available, whilst unnecessary
    details of the object are hidden
      - @position and @speed don't need to be known outside the class because
      they are only used by methods within the class (acceleration and move)
      - This principle is important because it allows one to alter the class
      definition without affecting any other part of the program that uses that
      class
  3) Inheritance
    Principle allows the use of past classes to make a heirarchy or taxonomy of
    classes. For example, a fighter ship will have all the same properties as a
    ship, but it will also include the option to fire a missile. With
    inheritance you are able to take all the initial details, methods etc. from
    the parent class SHIP, and also add your own fire_missile method within the
    subclass of fighter
      - Signified by < syntax i.e. class Fighter < Ship
  4) Polymorphism
    Principle allows for the implementation details to be changed to fit the
    specific class without changing any identifiers, interface or name that is
    needed to access them.
      - Ex: Fighter not only fires missiles but also travels faster than normal
      ship, so may increase ACCELERATION to 2 without having to change the name
      of the constant ACCELERATION
        class Fighter < Ship
          ACCELERATION = 2
          def initialize
            super()  ------- If you change the initialize method, you have to
            @missiles = 10   call super on it so that it will call the same
          end                properties as the parent class.
    5) Single-responsibility principle
      States that each module, class or function in a program should have
      responsibility over a single part of that programs functionality. All of
      that module, class or functions services should align with that
      responsibility only.
        - A class or module should have only a single reason to be changed.
          Ex: method to compile and print a report. If it needed to be changed
          because the report itself could change, or the format of the report
          could change. These are two separate issues and thus should be
          treated in separate classes or modules. This has implications in
          robustness of code, so that if something needs editing, there is a
          lower likelihood of messing something unrelated up.


Examples of each principle:

1) Data abstraction - we want our data to describe our real life equivalent
  ex: Dog

  class BrownDog(fur_color)
    def initialize
      @fur_color = fur_color
      @legs = 4
      @ears = 2
      @badbreath = true
      @age = 0
      @tail = 1
    end
    def leg_amputation(legs_amputated)
      @legs -= legs_amputated
    end
    def brush_teeth
      @badbreath = false
    end
  end

2) Encapsulation - Hiding the details of particular objects within a class,
                   while making
  ex: Cat

  class Cat(hair_length, size, species)
    def initialize
      @hair_length = hair_length
      @size = size
      @species = species
    end

    def hair_length
      @hair_length
    end                  *Using encapsulation, the data of hair_length, size,
                          and species are only available within the class when
    def size              the methods are called upon by that object specifically
      @size
    end

    def species
      @species
    end
  end

3) Inheritance - Using a prior class to give characteristics of a subclass

  ex:

  class Cat(hair_length, size, species)

  attr_accessor :hair_length, :size, :species

    def initialize
      @hair_length = hair_length
      @size = size
      @species = species
    end

    def hair_length
      @hair_length
    end

    def size
      @size
    end

    def species
      @species
    end

    def climb_trees
      puts 'I climb trees for fun'
    end
  end

  class JungleCat < Cat
  end

  tiger = JungleCat.new('short', 'large', 'tiger')
  tiger.species == 'tiger'

4) Polymorphism - Being able to change a certain class w/o changing identifiers

ex:
  class JungleCat < Cat

    def climb_trees     ---- I can change the inside of this method, so I can
      puts 'I climb trees to catch prey'  make it more specific to JungleCats
    end
  end

  tabby = Cat.new('short', 'small', 'brown tabby')
  tiger = JungleCat.new('short', 'large', 'tiger')

  tabby.climb_trees == 'I climb trees for fun'
  tiger.climb_trees == 'I climb trees to catch prey'

5) Single Responsiblity Principle

  class Cat(hair_length, size, species)

  attr_accessor :hair_length, :size, :species

    def initialize
      @hair_length = hair_length
      @size = size
      @species = species
    end

    def store_cat         Currently this program both stores a cat and validates
      ...                 whether or not the cat is true, which is in violation
    end                   of the SRP.

    def validate_cat
      ...
    end
  end


  *Instead we should make cat_validator its own class

  class CatValidator(parameters)
    def initialize
      @parameters = parameters
    end

    def validate
    ... #true or false
    end
  end
