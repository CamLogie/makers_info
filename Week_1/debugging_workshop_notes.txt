Debugging Workshop

What is a bug?

  A bug is an issue in the program, an error in the code, or when the code
  doesn't run as expected.

Mantra @ Makers:
  "Tighten the loop and get visibility"

  TIGHTEN THE LOOP: find the exact line the bug is coming from
  GET VISIBILITY: print to the terminal, check variables etc.

How to debug:

1) Run a specific line within rspec

  rspec ./spec/appointment_spec.rb:9 -- gives file and line number

2) Look at the spec file to try to understand what the test is asking from the
program

  Use the error message received in step one to figure out where the problem
  might lie

3) Open the actual program file

  Get visibility on the specific method or variables by "p"ing them

4) Run spec file to see the output

5) Repeat
