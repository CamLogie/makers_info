3 Competencies of Self-Awareness:

Self-Awareness is 'cornerstone of EQ'

  Understanding Emotions:

    Accurately be able to understand what you're feeling at any given moment.

      - Energy in motion - emotions are universal, more uncomfortable emotions
        we tend to deal with in unhelpful ways
      - Managing emotions in a healthy way, deliberately. Moving from compulsion
        to choice
      - Often over identify with our emotions "I am angry" vs "I feel angry"


    Tools:

      - "Go into the body" - affect labeling, go into the body and label the
        physical sensations associated with the emotion, be as descriptive as
        you want - 30 - 90 seconds
      - "I feel the way I feel and that's ok." - make peace with where you are
      - Breathe - 2x breathing, breathe out at 2x the count / 4-7-8 breathing

  Self Awareness:

    Accurate self assessment, understanding shortcoming and weaknesses, as well
    as strengths having a healthy attitude - practice shortcomings, being
    comfortable in own skin

  Confidence:

    Leaning into risk taking, going through life with a sense that whatever life
    brings me, I can handle it.
